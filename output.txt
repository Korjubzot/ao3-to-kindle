Morning prayers never came easy, no matter how many times Father Wulfhere or his father encouraged them. 
How could they when they roused him from peaceful dreams into the cold January days, not even giving him time to properly adjust before commanding him to get on his knees.
To Oswald, morning prayers were just as bad as sour milk or under cooked meat. Hard to swallow, leaving a bad taste in your mouth.
And this morning was no exception.
"Get up Oswald."
Father Wulfhere's gravelly voice greeted him,
"Get up before your father gets here."
"Father will be praying with Lady Ealswith."
"Yes, but when he finishes he'll be here. Now get up!"
The royal palace in Chippenham, built in the days of Oswald's great grandfather King Egbert, was a Great Hall type building, housing several rooms filled with the royal family, their servants, and the King's Housecarl.
Oswald's room, on the smaller side, contained some luxuries such as a soft and comfortable bed (which he did not want to be pryed from) a writing desk for letters, chairs, and well insulated walls to keep the cold out.
Unfortunately for him, his father enjoyed praying outside in the freezing winds. 
Unpleasantness, his father always said, pleased God more than an easy life.
Maybe so, Oswald thought, but he never aimed to be a saint.
Suddenly a rough hand gripped his shoulders and he was dragged onto the stone floor, face sliding on one of the pointier ones.
"Oww!"
"I said get up boy. So get up."
Oswald opened his eyes, taking in the grey stone momentarily, then got up, Father Wulfhere standing by the window, elderly face grinning.
"You're one cranky man for a 'soldier of Christ.' Isn't a priest supposed to be more cheerful?"
"Some maybe,"
Wulfhere laughed,
"But me? I'm God's cranky priest. He sends me to kick the arses of young bastards like you who don't want to do their prayers and be His servants."
"I never said I didn't want to be His servant,"
Oswald corrected him, knowing the priest referred to his refusal to enter the priesthood himself,
"I just don't want to be a man of the cloth. I actually like women, you see? So I'd like to get married."
"Yes, yes, I know young one. You've told me before. You are fortunate your father agreed to it, otherwise you'd be shipped off to a monestary."
Oswald wasn't stupid, he knew Wulfhere was right.
His father, King Alfred of Wessex, was known for his religious devotion and intended his eldest child, born out of wedlock with a serving girl when Alfred was a lad of fifteen, to enter the church, no doubt to atone for his father's sins of the flesh.
Instead young Oswald wanted to be a soldier and said so. Alfred, not pleased by what he saw as disobidence, nonetheless agreed, which is why Oswald was with the royal family in Chippenham now instead of some stuffy abbey or monestary learning Latin or singing hymns.
The Prince dusted off his tunic and joined Father Wulfhere and the two made their way out into the courtyard where they found the King, Alfred already deep in prayer.
Thin, with long light brown hair and small beard and mostache, the King didn't fit the image of what a warrior or monarch should look like. He was often sickly with stomach pains, cramps and sharp stabbing pains that came out of nowhere and affected his bowels and eating habits.
Oswald noticed as he got closer to his father that he had a hand on his stomach, gently massaging it.
"Forgive our tardiness Lord,"
Wulfhere said getting down on his knees beside him,
"Our young Prince decided sleep was more important than prayers again."
"Did he now?"
Alfred looked up at Oswald frowning.
"Father, that's not true. I was just...Just in a deep sleep. That's all."
"A man's relationship with God is far more important than sleeping in, my son."
The King crossed himself and bowed his head again.
"God is our rest. He is our best defense against the Pagans. To disrespect Him is folly."
"I wasn't disrespecting Him father. I didn't---"
"Enough Oswald. Join us in prayer, please."
Holding what he was about to say back he did what his father commanded, dropping down beside Father Wulfhere, clasping his hands together and beginning to pray.
They stayed seated in prayer for an hour, Alfred and Wulfhere reciting the rosary, the Beatiudes, and several other prayers while Oswald listened quietly.
On the other side of the courtyard the King's Housecarl, Eadwulf, stood guard, his eyes routinely scanning the grounds, thorough and precise. 
A veteran of the Viking wars under Kings Ethelwulf, Ethelbald, Ethelbert, and Ethelred, Eadwulf was an older man now but still strong as an ox and a better fighter than men half his age, including Alfred who he had trained himself as a boy.
His gnarled hand gripped his sword pommel, a blue diamond sticking out between his fingers. 
Oswald wanted to go over and talk with him, ask him questions about battle and the history of the Viking wars, but he dared not move for fear his father would yell at him or, if not that, lecture him on the virtue of piousness.
He knew his father meant well and wanted him to avoid sin, to be a good moral man, but this was not his way, it never would be. His faith in God was absolute, but he was starting to realize his idea of God differed greatly from his father's.
"Amen."
Alfred said crossing himself one final time and standing up, stretching.
"Father, would you care to join my family for breakfast?"
"I would be most honoured Lord."
"Good."
The King smiled gripping the priest's shoulder a moment before walking towards Eadwulf.
"You too old friend. No standing around for you this morning. Eat with us."
"Yes Lord."
The older man saluted and said no more, but Oswald could tell he was touched by the offer.
"And Oswald."
Alfred swung around, his finger pointed at his son.
"Yes father?"
"Try to be on time tomorrow. Come, let us eat."Roasted chicken, fruits of various kinds, and cheese were the main course of their breakfast meal, Oswald being seated on the opposite side of the table facing his father. 
His stepmother, Ealswith, pregnant, sat next to the King, absorbed in slicing up her meat into tiny pieces, worried she may choke otherwise given past experience.
Next to Lady Ealswith sat their eight year old daughter, Oswald's half sister Ethelflaed, who did more playing with her food than eating it. She found it far more fun to rip the chicken apart with her hands than using a fork to cut it up as her mother admonished her.
On either side of Oswald Father Wulfhere and Eadwulf sat, the two men enjoying their meal enormously, not often did they get to have this quality of food.
"Father,"
Alfred finished chewing a piece of cheese as he addressed the priest,
"Have you found the copy of Saint Augustine's Confessions that I've asked to borrow?"
"Not yet Lord,"
Wulfhere shook his head and picked up his ale glass,
"I seem to have misplaced it among my other books. If I can't find it I'll find another for you."
"I'd appreciate it. My dear mother gave me a copy years ago but due to my carelessness I lost it."
"Saint Augustine was a great mind. Proved beyond doubt why ours is the True Faith."
Oswald glanced at the priest, not surprised to find the strong sense of conviction in his expression.
"Indeed."
Alfred leaned back in his chair, a hand on his stomach. This time however it was done as a sign of contentment rather than pain.
"Will you be presiding over the Epipphany feast? Or will Father Elfwine be the one?"
"Elfwine needs experience,"
Wulfhere said, confirming he wouldn't be conducting the service,
"A zealous soul but lacking in handling the flock."
Oswald picked at his carrots. Elfwine, a young priest from Northumbria, had recently arrived under orders from the Archbishop of Canterbury, Ethelred, asking Wulfhere to train him.
Elfwine was, like Oswald, a bastard, a son produced in the Archbishop's youth with, rumours said, a lost lady love who died of birth complications soon after her son was born. This event, these rumours stated, were what drove the Archbishop towards the church, finding solace in God and his scriptures.
Oswald met the Archbishop several times and he was one of the few people who never treated him differently due to his birth, perhaps because of his own son's status. 
From all of their interactions the Prince could say he thought the Archbishop was a good man, one who took Christ's teachings to heart and tried to implement them in his daily walk with God. 
Full, Oswald pushed his plate back and like his father leaned into his chair, locking his fingers and resting them on his stomach.
Ethelflaed, seeing him do this did the same, giggling as she did so.
Ealswith, usually stoic, smiled at her daughter's laugh and for a rare moment Oswald was permitted to see just how pretty the Lady of Wessex truly was underneath the extrioror of a King's wife.
"Oswald, will you be joining us for the service?"
The question wasn't really a question. His father wanted him there as he always did. As much as the Prince wanted to say no he nodded.
"Yes father."
"You can sit beside me. We'll pray together."
Oswald gave a weak smile. He loved his father dearly and admired his faith, but praying beside him was getting old very fast.
Wulfhere added that afterward he could study the Bible with him, Oswald again nodded, his heart sinking at how boring it would----
"DANES! THE DANES ARE ATTACKING!"
A soldier busted through the door, laceration across his left shoulder bleeding profusely. 
Ealswith immediately grabbed Ethelflaed and practically ripped her off the chair in her haste once she heard the word Dane.
Alfred rose to his feet calmly, his eyes locking with Father Wulfhere.
"Take my wife and children away,"
The King commanded, then gestured to Eadwulf,
"Grab my sword and shield."
"Those Pagan bastards broke the treaty!"
The old warrior growled.
"Eadwulf, do not waste time or words on them, get my equipment."
"Yes Lord."
He went out and was back within minutes, Alfred taking the sword with ease, the shield was a bit heavier.
"There's no time to put on armour,"
The King said to his Housecarl,
"We'll need to fight a rearguard action. Chippenham is lost already but we don't have to fall with it."
Oswald wanted to stay and fight but Wulfhere's hand was already pulling him away down the hall. As they went the first sounds of shrill cries echoed through the royal residence. The sounds of those unlucky enough to bear the brunt of a Viking invasion.Guthrum watched the chaos around him, saw the English peasantry fall by the dozens by Danish swords and spears.
Bloodshed, while he knew it was necessary and did not shy away from it, wasn't something he particularly enjoyed. A trait many thought made him unworthy to be the son of Ivar the Boneless.
He made up for it by conquering much of England, putting down the naysayers with each victory. His father and uncles had begun the conquest in 865, now in 878 he was poised to finish it.
All that remained to be conquered was Wessex, once it fell Guthrum would be King of all England, the first man in the history of the land to be so.
Glancing at a red haired Dane, wolf's headdress on, crack open a priest's skull Guthrum grunted and walked on, passing burning homes and sheds.
Chippenham would be theirs within an hour or so, but his main prize had yet to be found.
Alfred, the sickly King.
The Viking warlord marched towards the royal palace, cutting down with one clean swing of his axe an English soldier who popped out of an alleyway. The look of confidence on the man's face turned to shock as the axe bit into his chest, cleaving into his heart.
Guthrum extracted his weapon and shoved the dead man aside, kicking open the unlocked doors and barging in, a group of warriors soon forming around him.
"Alfred!"
The son of Ivar cried searching each room with care, his men killing what remained of the guards.
"Alfred! Come out. Face me."
The King did not appear, there was to be no final confrontation between the two. To this Guthrum felt both a sense of relief and worry.
The relief due to his wish to not bloody his hands if he could help it. Worry because without the Wessex monarch's head on a pike, the English still had hope. 
"Lord,"
A warrior named Godfrid came running down the hall after checking the upstairs rooms.
"The King nor his family are here. They've escaped."
"I suspected as much."
Strapping his axe back into his belt Guthrum sighed and studied his new conquest. A home of a King wasn't anything new to him, he was, after all, the son of the late King of Denmark and Dublin, and grandson of the great Ragnar Lothbrok. 
He was, he realized, effectively the King of all England now. Alfred ran, his forces crushed under the weight of the Danes, and it was not only at Chippenham they attacked. 
A force of a thousand Viking warriors under his uncle Ubba also invaded Wessex at the same time he did, and if he knew his uncle Guthrum knew he succeeded in his conquest as well.
But he would not let himself get too comfortable too soon. He may be King of England and have control over the entire land, but he knew what hope could do. 
Hope, in the form of a living and defiant Alfred, could see the whole entirprise undone. See the crown of England taken from his head and Guthrum refused to allow that to happen.
His mark in history would be the unification of England under his rule. Nothing could stand in the way of that.
Guthrum turned to Godfrid, the rat faced man bowing his head, waiting for orders.
"Find Alfred and his family. Do not rest until they are found. When they are, gut them all."
"Yes Lord."
"And bring me their heads as proof."So fast. It all happened so fast.
Oswald and the others followed Father Wulfhere from the dining room, leaving the King and Eadwulf to hold off the Vikings, and they zig zagged through the palace until they reached the front entrance.
Then a dozen Danes attacked, guards doing their best to hold them back but failing in the attempt. Oswald's stepmother and sister, about to be swarmed by the invaders, ran. They managed to slip through a side door that led outside, but the Prince and priest were unable to follow.
"Come on lad!"
Wulfhere growled and gripped Oswald's arm, dragging him towards a window. The elderly priest smashed it out with an elbow and forced his charge to go through it.
Once on the other side the two men scrambled to escape Chippenham as smoke and the smell of flames hit their senses, making Oswald's eyes water, though whether it was from the smoke or his emotions he could not say.
He caught sight of two Danes dragging a woman, a servant girl he recognized, into one of the houses and went to draw his sword, but Wulfhere held his arm back.
"No!"
He said,
"You'll get yourself killed."
"She needs help."
"She's dead."
The words hurt the priest to say but he quickly steeled himself and pulled Oswald along again. 
Avoiding rampaging Danes the two made it safely out of Chippenham out into the countryside where Wulfhere hid them in the forest.
They stayed here a day or so before moving on, the priest intending to take his charge to Henley, a small, obscure village where he believed they'd be safe.
It took another day to reach the village, its people welcoming and friendly once it became known who they were and whence they came.The villagers of Henley fed the Prince and Father Wulfhere, giving them the Chieftain's house to sleep, the Prince having his and his wife's bed and Wulfhere their oldest son's.
It left a few kinks in his neck but it was, Wulfhere commented while they washed in the nearby river the next morning after their first night, better than the cold earth.
True enough, but the bloody kinks still hurt.
Word reached them on their third day in the village that Wessex fell to Guthrum. Alfred survived the attack on Chippenham but was nowhere to be found, having gone into hiding.
Oswald was eating porridge when he learned of his father's disappearance, confused and troubled by it.
"Where could he have gone?"
He asked Wulfhere beside him, the priest pulling apart a hunk of bread.
"Perhaps Frankia? Or Ireland?"
"Father would never abandon England."
Of that Oswald was sure. Alfred was an Englishman and he would die on English soil, whether that meant being the last English King to fall in battle or not.
"He may not have had a choice, son."
Wulfhere said sympathically.
"We all have to make sacrifices."
"Father did not run."
Oswald said again, more forceful this time.
The priest did not push the matter further, letting it lie. The two continued eating in silence. 
"Danes!"
The cry went up, the word sending Oswald's heart racing almost instantously.
"Danes are coming!"
"We must run!"
Wulfhere threw his hunk of bread and stood up.
Oswald got up as well, but to a different purpose.
He unsheathed his sword.
"I'm tired of running. The men of Henley form some of the local Fyrd, we'll defend the village."
"No, you must---"
Oswald pushed past Wulfhere, leaving the priest in the house while he went out to fight.Guthrum watched the English warriors rush out to meet the Danish advance, their tunics giving away they were simple peasants, no match for the Viking warriors he had under his command.
This was proved true when the first wave of berserkers attacked. They demolished the frontlines of the English, killing and maiming.
One of the warriors coming up to replace the fallen caught Guthrum's eye.
He looked, he realized, remarkably like Alfred.
"The King is here!"
The warlord growled above the din of battle so all his men may hear him,
"The King is here! Slaughter them all!"
A cry went up, a whoop of victory, and the Vikings came on harder, their swords and axes working in unison to butcher their enemies.Blood splattered across Oswald's cheek, the teenaged boy beside him having his throat slit by a Dane who went after him next, gripping the Prince's shirt and raising his sword.
Oswald smashed him in the face with his sword pommel on instinct, thrusting it inside the man's gut.
Pulling it out he moved on, ducking a charging berserker's attack, and jumping again from a spear thrown at him, the Wessex Prince confronted death head on. 
His fear was palpable but he wouldn't stop.
He couldn't. 
Killing a Dane and flinching when a burst of blood hit his eye Oswald never saw the brute of a man coming behind him until he felt the blow.
It stunned him at first, knocking him on his face. The pain coming only later and it was agony.
On his feet as fast as he could be, he saw that his attacker was Guthrum, the son of Ivar.
The two stared at each other. Guthrum's eyes did not show hatred like Oswald's did. In the Dane's eyes was only ambition. 
Hunger.
This to him wasn't personal, only a means to an end.
To Oswald, it meant the destruction or survival of the House of Cerdic. Of England itself.
"Surrender and I will make your death quick."
Guthrum said in English, his accent thick.
"Let me send you to your God."
"I'll see him when I'm ready."
Oswald spat.
"Where's your father?"
Guthrum began circling him, his axe's head drenched in the blood of Englishmen and women.
"Like I'd tell you."
"You would, if you want to save this village."
Guthrum spread his arms and Oswald looked.
The villagers dying. Their homes burning.
Father Wulfhere was in the thick of the fighting, the old priest favoring one of his legs, a red mark spreading over it.
"Surrender Alfred, boy. England is mine."
"No!"
The Prince's defiance impressed Guthrum.
"So be it. Let us finish this then."
His attack was furious, bringing the axe crashing down on Oswald, the Prince's sword ringing with each hard strike, stinging his hands.
Lashing out Oswald landed a blow of his own, a slash to Guthrum's midsection.
His breastplate armour stopped it from going through.
WHACK!
Guthrum's free hand caught him with a left hook, popping out a tooth and throwing Oswald into the dirt.
Lights flashing in his vision the Prince coughed, tasting the salty, metellic taste of his own blood in his mouth.
"Stay down boy."
Guthrum said walking over.
"It will go easier if you do.'
Oswald gripped his blade and whipped it around, making a loud CLANG as it struck into the warlord's axe, rattling from the impact.
Guthrum kicked the blade out of his hands and went to swing the axe down on the Prince's head---
Driving his boot into the Danish leader's balls Oswald bought himself time, Guthrum stumbling backwards wailing.
"You little dog shit!"
Running to grab his sword Oswald looked around and saw Henley was lost.
He searched for Wulfhere, finding the priest laid up against a burning house.
Half his head missing.
Fighting back his emotions Oswald ran, leaving the doomed village behind, using the smoke to cover his retreat and faded into the forest.For months he lived off of berries and small game he managed to catch, having no contact with the outside world besides a few Danish patrols sent by Guthrum to capture him.
It wasn't until autumn of the next year, 879, that he learned what became of his father when a group of warriors, led by Eadwulf, found him in a cave.
Alfred, his Housecarl informed him, had escaped Chippenham and fled to the marshes of Athelney in Somerset. Here the King rallied men to him and within months, and following Ealdorman Odda's killing of Ubba at Cynuit, met Guthrum a final time at Ethandune where the King swore the Virgin Mary appeared to him in a vision, telling him how he must fight in order to win the battle.
Among the King's allies were Scots and Britons, both peoples tired of Danish raids on their lands, and together with the English this combined force beat Guthrum into submission.
In the peace treaty negotiations that followed the Danish Chieftain agreed to be baptized and accept Christ, taking the name Christian name of Athelstan and respecting the King's rights to Wessex. 
In return Alfred recognized him as King of East Anglia and all of the Danes in English lands, leaving all of England save Mercia and Wessex under his rule, though Eadwulf made it clear Alfred held superiority.
"How fares my sister and stepmother?"
Oswald asked the Housecarl, Eadwulf neglecting to mention them.
"Ethelflaed grows ever bigger,"
The older man smiled,
"And Ealswith is well, extremely well considering she just gave birth."
"She gave birth?"
"To a son. They named him Edward."
"And he will be father's heir."
Oswald said, not with malice or regret, but with happiness that Wessex now had a secure succession.
"The King wishes to see you, so we must hurry."
Eadwulf clapped Oswald on the back, leading him out of the forest.
"It will be good to bathe again."
Oswald said, more to himself than to the Housecarl.
"I bet it will,"
Eadwulf crinkled his nose,
"You stink."
The two men laughed mounting their horses.
The Prince took a final look at the forest, its ancient towering trees seeing him off.
